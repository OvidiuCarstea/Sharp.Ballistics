{"name":"Sharp.Ballistics Calculator","tagline":"Comprehensive ballistics calculator for long-range shooting, based on an excellent GNU Ballistics Library","body":"After discovering the awesome [GNU Ballistics Library](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ballisticslib/), I thought to myself: All existing ballistics calculators are either paid or too simple and thus unpractical to use. I wonder if I can create something that would be free as in \"free beer\" and still useful in the field. With this, I started this (pet) project - the Sharp.Ballistics Calculator. It is built to be highly configurable, so it should be adaptable to any rig and loadout - multiple presets of ammo, scopes and rifles can be configured for use in firing solutions.\r\nSo far there is only a desktop version, but at least Android (and maybe iOS) version is planned in (hopefully) near future.\r\n(really good chance to try mobile development here :D)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
