        <p>After discovering the awesome <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/ballisticslib/">GNU Ballistics Library</a>, I thought to myself: All existing ballistics calculators are either paid or too simple and thus unpractical to use. I wonder if I can create something that would be free as in "free beer" and still useful in the field. With this, I started this (pet) project - the Sharp.Ballistics Calculator. It is built to be highly configurable, so it should be adaptable to any rig and loadout - multiple presets of ammo, scopes and rifles can be configured for use in firing solutions.
So far there is only a desktop version, but at least Android (and maybe iOS) version is planned in (hopefully) near future.</p>

        <p><h4>The following screenshots show the configuration screens</h4></p>
        <p>Starting with definition of kinds of ammo we are going to use.

        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>Then, we can define what kind of scope we are going to use

        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
          Now, what kind of rifle do we have?
          <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/myarichuk/Sharp.Ballistics/gh-pages/images/screenshot4.JPG" />
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
          Now the shooting solution screen. Here all shooting conditions are entered and firing solution is calculated.

        </p>    
        <br/>
        <p>
          All that is nice, but what if I live in a country with other measure units? The following units can be adjusted
