        <p>After discovering the awesome <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/ballisticslib/">GNU Ballistics Library</a>, I thought to myself: All existing ballistics calculators are either paid or too simple and thus unpractical to use. I wonder if I can create something that would be free as in "free beer" and still useful in the field. With this, I started this (pet) project - the Sharp.Ballistics Calculator. It is built to be highly configurable, so it should be adaptable to any rig and loadout - multiple presets of ammo, scopes and rifles can be configured for use in firing solutions.
So far there is only a desktop version, but at least Android (and maybe iOS) version is planned in (hopefully) near future.</p>

        <p>The following screenshots show the configuration screens</p>
        <p>Starting with definition of kinds of ammo we are going to use.

        </p>
        <p>Then, we can define what kind of scope we are going to use
          <img src="/images/screenshot3.jpg" />
        </p>
        <p>Now, what kind of rifle do we have?
          <img src="/images/screenshot4.jpg" />
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the shooting solution screen. Here all shooting conditions are entered and firing solution is calculated.
